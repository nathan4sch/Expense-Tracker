After wanting to learn the React JS library and become more familiar with JavaScript, I set out to work on a project that would help me reach these goals. 

To help initially learn the React JS library I followed along with a youtube project tutorial by Maclinz. While following along, I researched sections that confused me and additionally learned using codeacademy. I wrote comments describing the functionality of the code in order to expand upon the application after finishing the video.

Once I had become more familiar with React JS, I set out to add my own implementations. This included fixing many bugs in the existing app such as in the background and dashboard component while also adding my own separate page for investments. For the Backend, this implementation required adding on to the existing Mongo database with a new module and controller specifically for investments. For the Frontend, navigation was first reworked to allow for an additional page. Then components and logic for adding, deleting, and displaying the data were created. With the investment page completed, I went ahead and added an investments section to the main dashboard and updated the graph component of the dashboard. Additionally, I reworked some of the styling to be more distinct between the different pages.
